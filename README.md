# Boilerplate | CasperJS with Grunt

## Set Up
1. `npm install`
2. `grunt test`
    or
    ```
    grunt casper
    ```
    or
    `grunt casper:functional`

### Note
If you need to hit your local server (as opposed to the remote server in the example), you'll have to fire that up first.
